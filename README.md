# Ideas

- Play songs at a certain time every day
    - Monday, 10am, Dawnson's Creek Theme Song (Season 1)
    - Friday, 5pm, Jurassic Park Main Theme
- 'DJ Potrainto' Can play playlists or songs when ordered
- Chug around the track and identify stations, or we could branch the track and it could do path finding somehow
- Send emails from 'conductor@potrainto.com'
- Send slack notifications
- Calls/texts Jagmit Gabba at weekends to let him know about special potato offers
- Has a 'freeroam mode' where it can go to stations and play targeted advertising messsages to station owners
- Deliver small items between stations and notify users of their arrival (can use a pressure sensor to detect whether it has been inserted/stolen before/during delivery) - can play the metal gear solid '!' when it gets to a station, or the Zelda 'chest opening', or some other sting.
- Broadcast motivational messages from noteworthy celebrities (DJ Khaled, Leonard Nemoy, George Takei, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bavZbQHbuOk) to make sure we are 'geared up' for work
- Play the coca-cola advert every day in the run up to christmas and deliver chocolates
- Go 'Ho Ho Ho', every few hours in the lead up to christmas
